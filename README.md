## Step-by-Step Instructor Notes:

### Step 1: Introduction
-  **Spring Boot REST API Demo**

Welcome to this code demonstration on building a RESTful API using Java Spring Boot! In this session, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of developing robust and scalable APIs with the popular Spring Boot framework.

##

Building web services that follow the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) is a crucial aspect of modern application development. RESTful APIs provide a standardized approach to communication between client and server, allowing seamless integration and data exchange.

Throughout this demo, we'll delve into the essentials of creating RESTful endpoints, handling various HTTP methods, implementing service layers, and incorporating best practices for designing scalable APIs. Whether you're new to Spring Boot or looking to enhance your understanding of RESTful API development, this session is designed to provide practical insights and hands-on experience.

Let's dive into the world of Spring Boot and uncover the power of creating efficient and well-designed RESTful APIs!.
## Purpose of the Code Demo:

The primary purpose of this code demonstration is to guide you through the process of building a RESTful API using Java Spring Boot. By exploring the provided codebase, you'll gain practical insights into the key components and best practices involved in developing a robust and scalable API.

## Learning Objectives:

1. **Understanding Spring Boot for API Development:**
   - Explore the basics of Spring Boot and its role in simplifying the development of Java-based applications.

2. **Creating RESTful Endpoints:**
   - Learn how to define RESTful endpoints to handle various HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
   - Understand the use of annotations like `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping`.

3. **Implementing Controller Layer:**
   - Delve into the separation of concerns by implementing controller layers.
   - Learn how these layers contribute to the overall structure and functionality of the API.

By the end of this demonstration, you should have a solid understanding of building RESTful APIs with Spring Boot, equipping you with the skills to embark on your own API development projects.


### Step 2: Setup

Before we dive into the code demonstration, let's ensure we have the necessary prerequisites and understand the key components of the provided codebase.

#### Prerequisites:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK):**
   - Ensure that you have Java installed on your machine. Spring Boot applications are Java-based, and having the JDK is essential.

2. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):**
   - We recommend using a Java IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for an optimal development experience. If you don't have one installed, download and set up your preferred IDE.

3. **Spring Boot:**
   - Familiarize yourself with Spring Boot. If you're new to Spring Boot, visit [spring.io](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) for installation instructions and documentation.

#### Codebase Overview:

The code in [src/main/java/com/example/demo/](src/main/java/com/example/demo/) serves as the starting point for our RESTful API. Here are key components to note:

- **`DemoApplication.java`:**
  - The main application class that serves as the entry point.
  - Contains the `main` method to run the Spring Boot application.

- **`DemoController.java`:**
  - A sample controller class with basic RESTful endpoints.
  - Demonstrates the use of annotations like `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping`.

Now that we've covered the prerequisites and code structure, let's proceed with setting up our development environment and exploring the code.


### Step 3: Demonstration

Now, let's dive into the code and explore each section step by step. We'll walk through the key components, explain essential concepts, and address potential challenges or questions.

#### 3.1 - Application Entry Point (`DemoApplication.java`):
   - Open `DemoApplication.java` and examine the main application class.
   - 1. **Annotation `@SpringBootApplication`:**
   - Observe the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation on the class. This annotation combines three commonly used annotations: `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`.
   - It marks this class as the configuration class and enables auto-configuration and component scanning.

2. **`main` Method:**
   - The class contains a `main` method with the standard signature for a Java application entry point.
   - When you run this class, it bootstraps the Spring Boot application.

3. **Spring Boot Application Initialization:**
   - The `main` method initializes the Spring Boot application, triggering the auto-configuration process.
   - Spring Boot automatically configures various components based on the classpath, simplifying the setup.

4. **Embedded Tomcat Server:**
   - Spring Boot includes an embedded Tomcat server by default. Therefore, when the application starts, it also launches an embedded web server to handle incoming HTTP requests.

5. **Application Configuration:**
   - Additional configurations can be specified in this class, such as external property files, database connections, or other settings required for the application.
   - Execute the `main` method to start the application and observe the console output.

#### 3.2 - Controller and RESTful Endpoints (`DemoController.java`):
   - Navigate to `DemoController.java` and explore the sample RESTful endpoints.
   - 1. **`@RestController`:**
   - The `@RestController` annotation is a specialized version of `@Controller`. It indicates that this class is a controller where every method returns data rather than a view.
   - With `@RestController`, each method's return value is directly serialized into the HTTP response body, making it suitable for RESTful APIs.

2. **`@RequestMapping`:**
   - The `@RequestMapping` annotation is used at both class and method levels to map web requests to specific handler methods.
   - At the class level, it sets the base path for all methods within the controller.
   - At the method level, it further refines the mapping, specifying the endpoint's path, HTTP method, and other attributes.

   - Execute HTTP requests using a tool like cURL or Postman to interact with the endpoints.


### Step 4: Conclusion
- Summarize the code demonstration.
- Recap the main takeaways.
